Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD): shows relationship between two Moving Averages (MA) for a security's price.
Calculated by subtracting 26-period EMA from 12-period EMA. (EMA - Exponential Moving Average)
Inference- MACD > Signal Line - Buy suggestion; MACD < Signal Line - Sell suggestion

It is advised to use MACD with another indicator such as Relative Strength Index (RSI) to analyse patterns more effectively.

Relative Strength Index (RSI): measures price change in relation to recent price highs and lows.
Calculated in 2 steps: 
RSI(step one) = 100 - [100/(1 + (Avg gain/ Avg loss))]
RSI(step two) = 100 - [100/(1 + (Previous Avg gain * n + current gain/ Previous Avg loss * n + current loss))]
n = period - 1 (in above code, period is 14, n will be 13)
Inference- It is a momentum indicator | Overbought > 70% ; Oversold < 30%
During downtrend, peak can be considered near 50%.

Limitations of both these indicators is they can give False Positive. One has to be careful and not to be completely reliable on the indicators when making investment decisions.
