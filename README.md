# Technical-Indicators

Technical indicators are future price signals, determined by mathematical computation on historic price, volume, or open interest information.
Leading Indicators: trend is about to start
Lagging Indicators: follows price action

There are mainly 4 types of technical indicators:
1. Trend Indicators - measure direction and strength of the trend.
   Eg.: Moving Average [lagging]; Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) [lagging]
   
2. Momemtum Indicators - identify speed of price movement by comparing prices over time; All analyse volume: All are leading indicators
   Eg.: Relative Strength Index (RSI); Stochastic Oscillator
   
3. Volatitity Indicators - Measure rate of price movement regardless of direction; All are lagging indicators
   Eg.: Bollinger Bands; Average True Range (ATR)
   
4. Volume Indicators - Strength of a trend or continuous trading direction based on averaging
   Eg.: Chaikin Oscillator [leading]; On-Balance Volume (OBV) [leading]; Volume rate of change [lagging]
   
I will be uploading programs for many of the technical indicators in this repository. Stay tuned!
